### If you know me as photografer, please see [here](/#work).

I like to call myself a software engineer. However, as a computer scientist, the best way to describe the things I do at work is: 
**Solve others' problems using computers, code, and design.**

I like coding and the variety of issues we can solve using code as a tool. I also like data and how we can model the world using simple structures. But design and design thinking have been the best way to understand how to make life easier for our customers. I also invest a lot of time in photography, books, brewed coffee, and well-made caprinhas.
